<h1 class="sr-only">About me</h1>

I'm a DC-area transplant living in New York City. The longer I live here the more
I'm convinced it's the best city in the world.

I'm currently the Engineering Manager of the Internationalization Platform team
at <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>.
Previously I was a <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/dan-na">Staff Engineer and the Team Lead</a>
of the same team. The content of this blog does not reflect the opinion of my employer.

Previously I was an Engineering Manager on the Product Infrastructure team at
<a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>. Other roles I held
during my tenure at Etsy included the Engineering Manager of the Accessibility
team, Senior Software Engineer on the Front-end Infrastructure team and
Software Engineer on the Mobile Web and Performance teams.

When I have lessons to share I enjoy <a href="/talks">speaking at conferences</a>.

In my free time I like to spend time with my wife and son, explore different
ethnic eateries throughout the boroughs, cook, and play basketball. I love but
rarely update my cooking blog: <a href="http://www.fooddontlie.com">Food Don't Lie</a>.

I'm a <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org/about-cheekswab/founders-story/">leukemia survivor</a>
and the creator of <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org">cheekswab.org</a>.
I use my story to engage with ethnic minority groups and coordinate bone marrow drives
in New York City and nearby areas. Please visit Cheekswab or reach out to me directly to learn
more about bone marrow donation and joining the BeTheMatch Bone Marrow Registry.
It truly is the lottery to save a life.

I'm probably listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz1Xn1vzOM4">90s hip hop</a>.

I'm a DC-area transplant living in New York City.  The longer I live here the more I'm sure it's the best city in the world.

I am currently a senior software engineer on the UX Infrastructure Team at <a href="http://www.etsy.com" title="Etsy" target="_blank">Etsy</a> in Brooklyn.  My current focus within UX Infrastructure is on the Accessibility team. The content of this blog does not reflect the opinion of my employer.

In my free time I like to spend time with my wife, explore different ethnic eateries throughout the city, cook, and play basketball.  I nerd out about food on my cooking blog: <a href="http://www.fooddontlie.com" target="_blank">Food Don't Lie</a>.

I'm a <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org/about-cheekswab/founders-story/" target="_blank">leukemia survivor</a> and the creator of <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org" target='_blank'>cheekswab.org</a>.  I use my story to speak and coordinate bone marrow drives in New York City.  Please visit Cheekswab or reach out to me directly to learn more about bone marrow donation and joining the BeTheMatch Bone Marrow Registry.  It truly is the lottery to save a life.

I'm probably listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA2_-eQ26tY&t=18s" target="_blank">90s hip hop</a>. I'm still convinced the 90s were the best decade.

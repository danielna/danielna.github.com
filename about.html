I'm a DC-area transplant living in New York City.  The longer I live here the more I'm sure it's the best city in the world.
</p>

<p>
I am currently a software engineer on the Front End Infrastructure Team at <a href="http://www.etsy.com" title="Etsy" target="_blank">Etsy</a> in Brooklyn.  The content of this blog does not reflect the opinion of my employer.
</p>

<p>
In my free time I like to spend time with my wife, explore different ethnic eateries throughout the city, <a href="http://www.fooddontlie.com" target="_blank">cook</a>, and play basketball.

<p>
I'm a <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org/about-cheekswab/founders-story/" target="_blank">leukemia survivor</a> and the creator of <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org" target='_blank'>cheekswab.org</a>, which continues to passively exist on the web as a resource to learn more about bone marrow donation and joining the BeTheMatch Bone Marrow Registry.  If you're unaware of what those are, please read up and consider joining.  It truly is the lottery to save a life.

<p>
I'm probably listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA2_-eQ26tY" target="_blank">90s hip hop</a>. I'm still convinced the 90s were the best decade.

<p class="caption">Manhattan via Astoria, Queens</p>

<p class="first">
I'm a DC-area transplant living in New York City.  The longer I live here the more I'm sure it's the best city in the world.
</p>

<p>
I am an Engineering Manager on the Accessibility Team at <a href="http://www.etsy.com" title="Etsy" target="_blank">Etsy</a> in Brooklyn. I believe that technology products should work for all people, regardless of mental or physical impairments. Previously I've worked as a senior software engineer on the Mobile Web, Performance, and Front-end Infrastructure teams. I've <a href="http://talks.danielna.com">spoken at a few conferences</a>. The content of this blog does not reflect the opinion of my employer.

<p>
In my free time I like to spend time with my wife, explore different ethnic eateries throughout the boroughs, cook, and play basketball.  I love but too rarely update my cooking blog: <a href="http://www.fooddontlie.com" target="_blank">Food Don't Lie</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm a <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org/about-cheekswab/founders-story/" target="_blank">leukemia survivor</a> and the creator of <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org" target='_blank'>cheekswab.org</a>.  I use my story to engage with ethnic minority groups and coordinate bone marrow drives in New York City.  Please visit Cheekswab or reach out to me directly to learn more about bone marrow donation and joining the BeTheMatch Bone Marrow Registry.  It truly is the lottery to save a life.

I'm probably listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA2_-eQ26tY&t=18s" target="_blank">90s hip hop</a>. I'm still convinced the 90s were the best decade.

        I'm also a <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org/about-cheekswab/founders-story/" target="_blank">cancer survivor</a> and the creator of <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org" target='_blank'>cheekswab.org</a>, which continues to passively exist on the web as a resource to learn more about bone marrow donation and joining the BeTheMatch Bone Marrow Registry.  If you're unaware of what those are, please read up and consider joining.  It truly is the lottery to save a life.

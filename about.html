        This blog is the current implementation of a long lineage of blogs, dating back to the mid-90s and the time when Geocities and Angelfire reigned supreme.

        I am <a href="http://blog.danielna.com/2013/05/19/cracker-barrel-and-hackerschool.html">currently a developer/student</a> at <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com" title="Hacker School" target="_blank">Hacker School</a> in New York City!  <strong class="fantastic">IT IS FANTASTIC.</strong>

    <p>In 2006 I was diagnosed with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.  I was 20 years old and a junior in undergrad.  It was a terrifying, humbling, and life-changing experience.  It's left an indelible mark on how I view health, God, work, and life.</p>

            In January 2012 I launched <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org" title="Cheekswab.org" target="_blank">Cheekswab.org</a>, a website/movement dedicated to spreading the word about bone marrow donation to ethnic minority groups.  <a href="http://www.cheekswab.org/about-cheekswab/founders-story/" title="Founders Story" target="_blank">Read more about Cheekswab here</a>.

        In August 2012 I reached my five year post-diagnosis mark and was declared cured by my doctors.  It was one of the <a href="/2012/08/20/cured.html" title="Cured">greatest days of my life</a>.

        I bought a Lumix GF-1 on impulse off of craigslist about a year ago.  I love its size and capabilities, and it's forgiving enough to make a photography hack like myself seem semi-competent.  The majority of the photos on this site will be taken with that camera, like the one you see above.

        This blog isn't limited to any topic in particular.  I do enjoy writing and would like to complete more long-form pieces, but only time will tell how successfully I do that.  I'd like to experiment specifically with typography, layout and photos.

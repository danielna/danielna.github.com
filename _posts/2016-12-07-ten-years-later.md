On December 7, 2006, as a 20 year old junior at the University of Pennsylvania,
I was diagnosed with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Today marks 10 years from
the date of that diagnosis. Today I'm 30, married, and live and work in NYC.

Admittedly the anniversaries of my diagnosis have become less important over time.
The first several years were particularly significant but each
subsequent year, [outside of the 5th post-remission year when I was considered
cured](http://blog.danielna.com/2012/08/20/cured.html), were less. In recent years
December 7th has come and gone without me even
remembering. But for some reason December 7, 2016 has held special significance
and I've distinctly thought about it more in the weeks approaching today. A
decade as a unit of time seems really, really long.

My time with cancer fills me with cognitive dissonance. I have experienced and
witnessed its unrelenting, destructive power, both first-hand and via the
stories I see shared almost daily on my Facebook feed. I read the blog posts of
desperate parents describe their anguish as their young children enter palliative
care. I remember watching my mother face away from me at my hospital bed because
any glance in my direction would cause her to break down into tears. I remember
walking laps around my hospital floor as a bald, then 21 year old cancer patient,
peering into the ever-changing rooms of bed-ridden patients 40-50 years older
than me, wondering what in the world I was doing there. My cancer
diagnosis was marked heavily by moments that were very, very surreal.

The dissonance comes from the so many intensely good things that sprung from the
bad. The instant reconciliation of relationships I experienced on my hospital bed.
A loving and supporting wife, with the unexpected beginning of a relationship
over AIM due to my chemo-induced house arrest and her watching over her
newborn baby cousin.  My forever existential crisis that makes me reevaluate
if what I value and how I spend my time does justice to my second chance
at life. The constant reminder to be thankful and not take anything for granted
despite light and momentary troubles. The privilege to [use my story to speak for
ethnic minority patients who face similar diagnoses and advocate for their health](http://www.cheekswab.org/).

The start of chemo marked the end of thinking about my life in large chunks of
time. In college I had the same expectations as most of my peers: graduation,
marriage, a kid, corner office. While the details were fuzzy I had a rough
vision of what my life would look like at 30, 40, 60.

In the hospital those expectations felt like an exercise in premature
disappointment. I have distinct memories of watching my friends leave my room,
wondering to myself if these were our last conversations. If next week wasn't
assured then what was the point of thinking in decades?

I've become something of a cancer liaison for my extended social circle because
most people around my age don't have peers who have been through things like
this. I get occasional emails asking me if I'd be willing to talk to \_\_\_ about
what I've been through. And the single most important piece of advice I offer is one
of perspective: tomorrow will take care of itself. Focus on today. Live your life
one day at a time.

And here I am, in 2016, writing this blog post. 10 years gone, a day at a time.
A part of me can't believe that I'm alive today.

A small voice inside of me is surprised that I'm writing this post and sharing
it so publicly. It's the same voice that felt uneasy the first time I applied
to internships after I entered school again. How would I explain the gap in
my resume from taking time off for chemo and recovery? Would a hiring manager
assume a gap in school wasn't worth the effort to contextualize in the midst of
other qualified candidates without a gap? Was it worth a potentially awkward
conversation across an interview table to explain my time off and my school transfer?

I sat in my bedroom watching the cursor blink on my resume. And I resolved that
night that my sickness was not a liability. I was not ashamed of being sick. I
was not ashamed of my less-conventional path. I was not ashamed of the sum of
the pain and joy and frustration and elation of the last few years. I was not
ashamed of how much it matured me and expanded my understandings of time, love,
life and death.

I updated my resume with a couple sentences explaining my time away from school
and my sickness. I got the internship.

Surviving and learning from hardship is an asset, not a liability.

I'm going to end this post with a story of one of my biggest regrets over the
last 10 years.

In the spring of 2008 I went back to UPenn to see my friends graduate (2008
was my normally scheduled graduation year -- I ended up transferring to UVA
and graduating in 2010).  By then I was in remission and had been out of
treatment for a year, and I was taking an academic year off between
transferring schools to get my mind/body right.  My girlfriend at the time
(now wife) and I got there a few days early just so I could walk around and see
the campus again.

We were walking down Locust Walk, the main walkway through the heart of campus,
and the weather was wonderful. The campus wasn’t too busy, the squirrels were
busy investigating the contents of the campus trash cans, and most of the
undergraduate student body had left for home.  It was your typical, care-free
Spring stroll.

And then I saw her.  A woman cut onto Locust right in front of me and I
recognized certain characteristics immediately.  I recognized the red and white
wristbands, I recognized the hat covering her otherwise hairless scalp, and
most potently I immediately recognized the face-mask covering her mouth.
Probably no older than 27, she walked in front of me for a bit, book in hand,
and sat down on a bench to read.  Undoubtedly a bit self-conscious of her
face-mask and general appearance, she didn’t look at anyone.  She just sat down
and began to focus on her book.

She was likely neutropenic, which is a chemotherapy-induced state of
immunodeficiency, or at least on the upswing.  With the proximity of Locust
Walk to the university hospital (and particularly the cancer wings), I was
positive she was a cancer patient.  Chemotherapy gave reason to her hat and
necessitated the use of her face-mask.

I had been exactly in her spot almost a year before.  A cancer patient, tired
of the prison that a hospital room becomes, throwing their social insecurities
to the wind for the sake of walking around among the world and feeling normal
again.  True, there are definite dangers to walking around outside the hospital
as an in-patient, but for a brief glimpse of normalcy, and nature, and for the
sake of sanity, it’s a risk that you’re willing to assume.  What’s the point of
fighting for your life if you don’t feel alive in the first place?

I saw her, I recognized her, and I walked past her.  I wanted to stop, and I
wanted to talk to her, and share my experiences and tell her to press on, to
hang on to hope and love and faith and come out clean at the other end of her
tunnel. I wanted to say something, anything, to reassure her.  YOU ARE NOT
ALONE, I should have said.  I WILL PRAY FOR YOU, I should have said.  GOD BLESS
YOU, I should have said.  I should have stopped and looked her in the face and
asked her how she was doing and encouraged her. I should have told her that I knew
how she felt. But instead I said nothing.

I walked past her, leaving her to her book and her literal and figurative
moment in the sun. I don’t want to interrupt her, I said. I don’t want to be a
nuisance, I said.  What can I tell this girl that she doesn’t already know, I
said.

I have replayed that moment in my head so many times since that day. And while
I wanted to respect her privacy (and would have, had she brushed me off or
asked me to go away), I can't help but think that my own self-consciousness got
in the way of sharing a real, empathizing moment with someone who, like me,
probably had few peers to empathize with. I could have given that woman a real
glimpse of hope in a very difficult time. But I walked by.

My regret serves as my reminder.  It's a reminder that no matter how long any
of us live, there is a limited time to be real, and to give hope, and to engage
and empower and love others who absolutely need it. There's no assurance that
10 years from now will come.

The time to have that impact is now.

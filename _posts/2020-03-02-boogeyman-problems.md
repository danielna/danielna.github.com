title: Boogeyman Problems
subtitle: Sometimes the scariest challenges are the most important.

I started my tech career in the early 2000's, and there was a period of several
years (from ~2008 onward) where I can imagine a lot of conversations at companies
that went like this:

> Person A: "Hey, have you looked at Google Analytics recently?"
>
> Person B: "No, why?"
>
> A: "The website is starting to see some traffic from phones."
>
> B: "Huh. Interesting."
>
> A: "Yeah."

_Time goes by_

> A: "Hey, have you looked at Google Analytics recently?"
>
> B: "No?"
>
> A: "Our mobile web traffic grew 150% last year. One out of every five people
who visit the site are visiting on a phone."
>
> B: "Woah."
>
> A: "Our website only really works on a desktop computer."
>
> B: "Yeah, but that's always been true. And it'd be a ton of work to make
things work on a phone and we're all pretty busy."
>
> A: "Yeah."
>

_More time goes by_

> A: "Uh, based on the charts in Google Analytics last month, more people visited
our website on a mobile phone than on a desktop computer."
>
> B: "But our site only works on a desktop computer."
>
> A: "Yeah."
>
> B: "Oh crap."

Everyone saw the rise of the mobile web, and some companies did something about it
and some didn't. It's important to remember that "sites should work on phones"
was not a foregone conclusion at that point by any means. Concepts like Responsive
Design and Mobile First were _bleeding edge_ at the time and required major
changes to design philosophies, engineering capabilities and workflows that spanned years.

Mobile web was a Boogeyman Problem.

There's a special class of problems that I call "Boogeyman Problems".

Boogeyman Problems are features or enhancements to products or infrastructure
that fit two criteria:

1. There's overwhelmingly clear evidence/validation on their long-term importance
and impact to the team/organization/industry.
2. Their cost of implementation is massive. I'll qualify "massive" as daunting refactors
to critical paths, very unclear boundaries around scope, and reassignments of
team priorities over months or years.

They're named "Boogeyman Problems" because, frankly, they're really scary.

Another common characteristic of Boogeyman Problems is they are paradoxically
easy to ignore. Some of that is prudent pragmatism: until the work is defined
enough to be actionable it doesn't make sense to stop working on everything else.
And there are always existing fires to fight and products to support.

The danger is when Boogeyman Problems are ignored _for years_. It is easy for
momentary "prudent pragmatism" to become "imprudent avoidance," especially when
you are so busy with your day to day responsibilities that it's easy to let
things that aren't immediately in front of your face slip. I'll go out on a short
limb and claim that most leaders are spread thin, so the opportunity cost for
planning around a massively important yet poorly defined problem is very high
when you're putting out day-to-day fires.

**But this is not a good excuse.**

At any scope of responsibility you cannot continue to avoid your most important
problems because you are too busy. The hardest and most important strategic
responsibility of leaders is to set priority, and that priority must dictate
your busyness. In fact, if you never make progress on the Boogeyman Problems
facing your team/organization then I'd argue that you're not making actual
progress at all.

I don't have a pithy solution here other than vigilance. Cut scope enough to
generate actionable milestones. Schedule periodic calendar invites with a few relevant
stakeholders to ensure the problem isn't being ignored. [Host Questionstorms](/questionstorms/).
Continue to compile evidence from the business that validate the existence of the
Boogeyman Problem and use that validation to justify staffing. And most
importantly: don't give up. Start somewhere, even if it's uncomfortable. Slow
progress on a hard problem is still progress, and infinitely better than ignoring
something because you don't know where to start.

You must [fight the normalization of deviance of "we're going to think about that problem later"](http://blog.danielna.com/talks/pushing-through-friction),
especially if that was the same answer one/two/many years ago. Your success depends
on it.

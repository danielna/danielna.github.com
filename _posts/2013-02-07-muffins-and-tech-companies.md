And they said, "Well, eventually we're going to get hundreds of people a day walking into our bakery to get free muffins, and we'll probably do this for a few years, and eventually we'll just start selling muffins."  I mean, that'd be ridiculous.  People would look at that and go, "that's a stupid idea."

>You could give away some muffin samples.  Break a muffin into fifty little small pieces and let people have that, and maybe sell them one today.  That makes sense.  And that's how people would look at something like a bakery.  Why aren't people looking at software companies and tech companies the same way?

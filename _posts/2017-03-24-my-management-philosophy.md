_Updated as of August 2019_

I wrote my original management philosophy in 2017 when I first started managing
an engineering team at Etsy. I've had much more management and IC experience
since then and wanted to update that original philosophy with additional perspective.

The link to my old post should redirect here. You can link directly to
this post via [http://management.danielna.com](http://management.danielna.com).
I'm hoping to update this post in the future as my management philosophy evolves
over time.

What follows is the slightly modified intro to my original blog post and my
<a href="#on-management-generally">management philosophy</a>.

I moved into management in January 2017. Etsy (like other large tech companies) has
two career paths: IC (individual contributor) or management. The obvious question: why?

I have various angles and answers to this question, but I think the most fundamental
and honest answer is that I think it appeals to my strengths. I had a glimpse of
a lot of management responsibilities in 2016 -- defining roadmaps, instilling process,
selling work up and down, mentoring -- and I enjoyed it. I like grappling with and
finding a way through uncertainty, particularly when it goes beyond purely technical
constraints. Choosing which technical framework to use to build a thing is hard, but it's
an entirely different problem to determine if building that thing is a good idea in
the first place. What are the externalities of that decision? How will it not only affect
its users, but also the people who build it?

It's not that I have a distaste or lack of belief in my ability to execute on technical
work -- the thrill of learning new technologies and shipping code is something
I still and will likely always love. Nor am I shutting that door completely. But for now
I like the challenge of my new role and I'm interested to see how the experience hones
my leadership skills.

My motivation for writing a document like this is transparency and accountability.
If you're on my team you deserve to know, explicitly, what I expect from you
and what you can expect from me. I think there's value in that clarity.

## On management generally

* A team is only as good/productive as its ICs. Effective management is about putting
those ICs in a place to be their best selves — adding (or removing) processes,
identifying opportunities for growth and exposure, and creating, communicating,
maintaining and validating a strategic vision around the team's work.
* Effective management cannot make a team of ineffective ICs produce high quality work.
But a team of highly effective ICs will be capped, both in the velocity and quality,
by ineffective management.
* "Culture" is what we do. The thousands of micro interactions within
our team and organization - attitudes, decisions, and behaviors - are
our culture. Writing out a list of values is easy and fast. Creating and
persisting a healthy, collaborate and just culture is hard, intentional, and a long game.
* [Push through friction](https://talks.danielna.com/webunleashed-2019/).
Friction is the crossroads you'll hit, over and over again, where you'll have
to decide for yourself if the steps necessary to complete a task are worth it.
When there is no convenient answer on how to move forward. When you may have
to fix 10 things you weren't responsible for to complete the one thing you are
responsible for. Making the best engineering decision will often have friction.
There’s often the correct path and the easy path. Take the correct path, even
if it’s hard, because it ultimately leads to better outcomes.

## On being your manager

* My goal is to empower you to be your best self, keep the team strategically on
track, help you reach career-related goals and handle higher level logistical details
(meetings, JIRA, etc) that keep you productive and fulfilled.
* I'm not interested in micromanagement. I believe in a culture of discipline,
meaning we are disciplined and mature professionals that can be held accountable
to delivering tasks without granular and overbearing oversight. I find micromanagement
as exhausting as you do.

## On our work as a team

* Shipping regularly is the most important indicator of a healthy team. Toxic
teams rarely ship, nor do teams with insufficient process or maturity. At the
end of the day we all work in this industry to ship impactful products to millions
of customers. Let's make sure that we all understand that the [practices and culture we adopt](/2018/08/20/understanding-project-management-will-improve-your-developer-job.html)
are in service of a team that ships high-quality work.
* I believe in transparency, integrity, and psychological safety among teams.
[Google spent years and millions of dollars trying to uncover what made their
most productive teams successful.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)
TL;DR: it was being real/genuine with each other.
* I believe in "smells." When does a process or project or task seem "off"? If
something smells, please tell me. That's your taste/experience/instinct talking,
and that's why we hire you, invest in you, and value your contribution.
* I believe in focus. We'll always be juggling multiple tasks at a time, but we
must be diligent in identifying and shipping our highest priorities. This is why
exercises like goal-setting, OKRs and VMSOs ([Vision Mission Strategy Objectives](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121029044359-22330283-to-manage-hyper-growth-get-your-launch-trajectory-right)) are
important. I would much rather ship four things in six months than half-ship
eight things in the same time frame. "Let's full-ass a few things, rather than
half-ass many things."
* I believe in accountability and ownership. Let's be proud of what we produce.
If something breaks and we own it, that's our reputation. That's our work.
Being accountable means that it's our responsibility to respond with empathy and action.
* Let's be [in the arena.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic)

## On working with others

* Let's be marked by maturity in our work and interactions. My thoughts on this
are well encapsulated by John Allspaw's blog post:
[On Being a Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
* I believe in data-driven and transparent decision making. You may notice that
something is a bad idea and want to comment on it; great! Your sense of smell is
important. But explaining the rationale of your decision — including constraints,
domain knowledge, long-term effects, etc. — is a much more meaningful and lasting
means of convincing someone else of your viewpoint. It also opens a dialogue
around the validity of your assumptions.
* Cultivate your backchannel. Invest in meeting and developing professional
relationships with your coworkers. Not only will it make this a better place to
work, but the backchannel is often the best and fastest way to get support or
context from across the organization.
* Pick your battles carefully. Stand up for what you believe in, but know that
fighting battles you don't care about will have diminishing returns on the battles
you do. I love this blog post about picking your battles: [The sliding scale of giving a fuck](https://capwatkins.com/blog/the-sliding-scale-of-giving-a-fuck)
* Assume best intentions. All people and teams have external factors (roadmaps,
deadlines, stresses, personal circumstances, etc.) that impact their priorities
and decision making. Gathering appropriate context around those factors is the
fastest and most enduring path to a meaningful solution. Sometimes you may not
have access to the full scope of those factors. Studies show that it takes 5
positive interactions to overcome a single negative interaction ([HBR article](https://hbr.org/2010/09/bad-is-stronger-than-good-evid), [PDF](http://assets.csom.umn.edu/assets/71516.pdf)).
Regardless, the old adage holds true: "be kind, for everyone is fighting a great battle."
* I don't believe in "brutal honesty." Brutality is never a virtue. Hard conversations
are sometimes necessary, but tact is always necessary.
* Inclusivity and equality in our team is important to me. If I see you behaving
in a way that is discriminating or disparaging of any particular group (e.g.
gendered language, stereotypes, inequitable treatment), I will address it. You
should feel comfortable to do the same for me and your peers.
* Celebrate a job well done. When people do something great, let them know. This
could be as large as a complex new feature to as small as a well-written commit
message or email. A celebratory culture is built one interaction at a time.

## On self-awareness

* I believe in [Daniel Pink's ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us)
on our intrinsic motivators: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. I encourage you to
continually revisit how those three motivators intersect in your role and be
proactive in identifying opportunities to expand them.
* Everyone has bouts of imposter syndrome (myself included). Imposter syndrome
is a struggle, but you would not have been hired if you were not capable of doing
your job. I have no doubt in your abilities to perform the responsibilities of your role.
* Burnout is real and its causes are not only limited to hours spent working.
Take care of yourself and please tell me when you're feeling overwhelmed or unhappy.
I'd rather have you leave early/take a break/switch tasks than burn out. You are
valued more than your job title. Our success as a team is a long game and burnout
undermines that success.
  * Caveat: Sometimes we'll need to really churn on work to meet stricter dates,
  but know that's the exception rather than the norm. We're not a culture of workaholics.
* Sometimes work is boring or unglamorous, but a sign of maturity is fighting through
the slog when you need to. Sometimes it's busy work. Getting the little things
out of the way will enable you to work on the big things.
* Be proactive about asking for help. If you need help or clarity you are always
able and encouraged to ask for it, but asking for that guidance is on you. Do
your best to understand the balance between powering through something and
spinning your tires (and if you're not sure of that balance, I can help).
Remember that in the end you ultimately own having full context of, and
delivering, your tasks.

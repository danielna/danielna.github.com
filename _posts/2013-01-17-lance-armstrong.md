I've met a lot of people who took real inspiration from Lance Armstrong, and I was personally inspired by his book when I read it during treatment. His interview doesn't seem to show much remorse other than the fact that he got caught, which is a shame. A part of me wonders if he would've been so obstinate about his "innocence" if he weren't such a symbol for millions of actively suffering people... but then I remember the millions of dollars of endorsements and his pervasive egotism even in the face of getting caught. And sadly, I just don't buy it.

Luckily people continue to live strong without the aid of a stupid yellow bracelet.

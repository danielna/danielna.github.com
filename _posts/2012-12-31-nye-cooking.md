I like to cook.

Almost everything I know about food is literally from watching hours of Food Network, with <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/good-eats/index.html" target="_blank" title="Good Eats">Alton Brown</a> as my preferred guide.  I'm not the best chef I know (that title is reserved for a <a href="http://www.sugarphillytruck.com/about/" title="About Sugar Philly Truck" target="_blank">friend of mine who runs a dessert food truck in Philadelphia</a>) but I like to consider myself somewhat competent in the kitchen.  I think it's lame when a person can't cook themselves a meal from real, fresh ingredients.  It's not a gender thing, it's an adult thing.

Following a recipe isn't something to be intimidated by.  If you can put together a piece of Ikea furniture, you can learn to cook a proper meal.  If you can't put together a piece of Ikea furniture...

Being sick as a dog on New Years Eve is not my preferred way to kick in the new year, but my girlfriend and I made the best of it by deciding to at least enjoy a homecooked meal.  As far as the menu goes, it's usually a combination of spur-of-the-moment inspiration and whatever one of us has left in the fridge.  Tilapia is healthy and easy to cook well so that was the protein.  I've been wanting to try incorporating coconut milk into a meal so I thought to mix it with some quinoa (keen-wah).  (Side note: the cheapest and best place to buy quinoa is on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG3UE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=musings01b1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000EDG3UE" target="_blank" title="Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa">Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=musings01b1-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000EDG3UE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />).  The guac called to us from the vegetable aisle, and I'm not much of a kale person but she's a fan.  We had our meal.

I prefer to bake things over pan frying them because it's less work/less smell/healthier, especially in large quantities.  I don't remember where I learned the technique but I remembered it was easy to bake fish filets in packets of foil.  Add some oil, some herbs, lemon, salt and pepper, and 20 minutes later (at 400 degrees) dinner is ready.

The best stuff to do when something is cooking is either prepare something else or clean up.  As the fish cooked it was time to make some guac.  Guac is nice because it's stupid easy and hard to screw up, barring an un-ripe avocado.  

<div class="photo-block">
    <img src="/assets/img/2012-12-31/11.jpg" title="Holy guacamole, batman"/>
    <div class="caption">Chop: avocados, onion, tomato, cilantro. Squeeze: lime. Sprinkle: salt and pepper.
    </div>
</div>

Split and de-seed an avocado, spoon out into a bowl.  Cut tomato into small chunks, put into bowl.  Cut onion (I prefer white, which aren't as overpowerlingly onion-y as red) into small chunks, put into bowl.  Slice a lime in half, squeeze into bowl.  Add chopped cilantro, salt and pepper to taste.  Kosher salt tastes better.  Mix with a fork.  

Eat with lime tostitos, which are amazing.

Fish should be done.  It should flake with a fork.  The packet technique is nice because it keeps things from drying out.

I don't have any pictures of the kale, but it's a pretty simple prep.  Wash kale, dry kale.  Lightly toss in a little bit of olive oil, salt and pepper.  Spread on baking pan, bake at 200 for 10 minutes.  It's done when it gets crispy to the touch.

My girlfriend also pan-steamed some frozen corn with a little bit of water, salt and pepper.  Done in a minute or so.

Not a bad plate, if I say so myself.  Total time from start to finish was about an hour.

One of my resolutions for 2013 is to cook more, and this post is something of a test in how I'd like to document that cooking.  It's a work in progress (both the food and the medium).  If I did it all over again I'd add more coconut milk to the quinoa.

Happy 2013!

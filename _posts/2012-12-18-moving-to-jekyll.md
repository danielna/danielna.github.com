I've moved from Tumblr to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" title="mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.

The straw that broke the camels back with Tumblr was how the CMS handled image uploads.  I really hated how Tumblr forced me to use one of their default rendering layouts based on the number of images I wanted to upload, and it required downright hacky behavior to circumvent all that.  Tumblr's competitive advantage is its social network, not its writing platform.

Jekyll is a static-site generator written in Ruby.  I decided to go with Jekyll for various reasons, including the ability to fully control my own markup, render the site locally, speed/performance, and nostalgia for the days of static HTML websites. There is a massive irony around here somewhere.

I like the idea of a blog being a testing ground for various technologies -- plugins, techniques, layouts, typefaces, etc.  I've used a lot of the major blogging services up until now -- xanga, typepad, blogger/blogspot, wordpress, tumblr -- but the more familiar I become with the possibilities of the web, the less I'm satisfied with the current offerings of rich text editors.

Thus, Jekyll.

I originally gave <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress" target="_blank">Octopress</a> a long look, but I felt like it provided too much functionality for free.  I'd rather learn to roll something from the ground up than strip away features from a framework that I only kind-of understand.

Unfortunately for prospective Jekyll users, the default docs are kind of horrendous.  The <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html" title="Jekyll Introduction" target="_blank">introduction at jekyllbootstrap</a> is a much better place to start.

<a href="http://github.com/danielna/danielna.github.com" title="Blog source @ github" target="_blank">Hosting things on github</a> is also really, really awesome.

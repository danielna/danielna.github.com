> The author Gay Talese, in an interview with The Paris Review, said he had no regrets regarding the fact that his books and articles had never won any awards and prizes. He said, "The only reward I have is the feeling that I have done the best I can."  And I've long drawn inspiration from this quote by Walt Disney: "We don't make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies."

> I can't say it any better than that.  True success is not about anything that can be measured -- money, awards, pageviews.  It's the intimate feeling that you've pushed yourself to do the best work you can.

<p>I really love this magazine. At ~$18/issue it doesn't come cheap, but it's not just a magazine as much as a piece of inspiration.  Each issue is beautifully designed with a focus on typography and layout, and the overarching topic -- "The Human Side of Websites and Apps" -- is exactly what I love to read.</p>

<p>Stories about people who worked their butts off to do what they love at a high level.  Work doesn't get any better than that.</p>

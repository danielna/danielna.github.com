    <div id="help-content">
        In June 2013 I started my three months at <a href="/2013/05/19/cracker-barrel-and-hackerschool.html" title="Cracker Barrel and hackerschool">hackerschool</a>.  This is where I'll keep a log of what I'm working on/thinking/experiencing/etc.  I'm envisioning something kind of like twitter, but less ephemeral.  It'll be similarly stream-of-conscience.  When I write longer-form posts that pertain to HS I'll link to it both here and on the homepage.

    <ul>
        <li>Everything kicked off with some networking and an inspiring introduction by Nick/David covering the ideology/atmosphere of hackerschool.</li>
        <li>HS uses a pretty cool chat app that was built by some HS alumni.</li>
        <li>Sadly the "nearby locations" for Yelp are all $$$-$$$$, but such is life in Soho (and NYC in general).</li>
        <li>Decided to make this log, both for future nostalgia and a way to tangibly track my progress moving forward.</li>
        <li>The diversity of the group is really amazing.  Older, younger, management consultants, ex-Wall Streeters, college students, a high school student, people who have programmed for 10+ years and people who have programmed < 1 year, people who live overseas, across the country, etc.  The diversity will be a tremendous asset for the batch.  Come to think of it, it's unlikely that I'll ever be part of another community during the course of my adult life that has this kind of diversity of people and experiences.</li>
        <li>Todo: <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">backbone.js</a> and <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a>.</li>

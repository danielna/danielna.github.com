    <div id="help-content">
        In June 2013 I started my three months at <a href="/2013/05/19/cracker-barrel-and-hackerschool.html" title="Cracker Barrel and hackerschool">hackerschool</a>.  This is where I'll keep a log of what I'm working on/thinking/experiencing/etc.  I'm envisioning something kind of like twitter, but less ephemeral.  It'll be similarly stream-of-conscience.  When I write longer-form posts that pertain to HS I'll link to it both here and on the homepage.

    <ul>
        <li>It's pretty remarkable to see how self directed everyone is. There's this unspoken pressure to focus or get "left behind."  Not in the sense that anyone is judging you (or even cares), but more that the opportunity cost of goofing off is big.  As Nick said yesterday, there aren't many programmers anywhere that get to focus solely on their craft for three months like this.</li>
        <li>While the level of experience of people here varies a lot, it's easy to see why the powers that be at HS don't accept completely inexperienced beginners to the program.  It's for their own benefit.  Without the knowledge to self-educate and/or be self-directed, itâ€™d be a waste of time to come here.  There's so little formal structure that it definitely lends itself best to those who can sit down and work on things immediately, or at least function without the need to have their hand held.</li>
        <li>You know that feeling when you're in a coffee shop working on something and there's enough ambient noise/activity that it keeps you awake but it's not distracting?  It's like that.  Except everyone is talking about programming.  It's awesome.</li>
        <li>I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316017930&linkCode=as2&tag=musings01b1-20" title="Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell" target="_blank"></a>Outliers on the 18-stop subway ride to/from HS, and it seems oddly serendiptious.  It wasn't intentional.  But the notion of 10,000 hours to master something... it's appropriate.  I've about halfway through, and while I feel like Gladwell can be unnecessarily verbose/includes too many redundant anecdotes to make a point, the crux of what I've read so far is this: while outliers are absolutely affected by external circumstances and sheer, dumb luck, working harder/smarter than their peers was a (as in, one of several) defining charateristic of their success.</li>
        <li>Todo: more <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">backbone.js</a>, which is really starting to come together mentally.  The fact that Addy Osmani released this book for free on the web is a testament to his character, because it's a very high quality and well-explained guide.</li>
    </ul>

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-03">Mon 6/3 - First Day!</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Everything kicked off with some networking and an inspiring introduction by Nick/David covering the ideology/atmosphere of hackerschool.</li>
        <li>HS uses a pretty cool chat app that was built by some HS alumni.</li>
        <li>Sadly the "nearby locations" for Yelp are all $$$-$$$$, but such is life in Soho (and NYC in general).</li>
        <li>Decided to make this log, both for future nostalgia and a way to tangibly track my progress moving forward.</li>
        <li>The diversity of the group is really amazing.  Older, younger, management consultants, ex-Wall Streeters, college students, a high school student, people who have programmed for 10+ years and people who have programmed < 1 year, people who live overseas, across the country, etc.  The diversity will be a tremendous asset for the batch.  Come to think of it, it's unlikely that I'll ever be part of another community during the course of my adult life that has this kind of diversity of people and experiences.</li>
        <li>Todo: <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">backbone.js</a> and <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a>.</li>

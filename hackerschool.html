    <div id="help-content">
        In June 2013 I started my three months at <a href="/2013/05/19/cracker-barrel-and-hackerschool.html" title="Cracker Barrel and hackerschool">hackerschool</a>.  This is where I'll keep a log of what I'm working on/thinking/experiencing/etc.  I'm envisioning something kind of like twitter, but less ephemeral.  It'll be similarly stream-of-conscience.  When I write longer-form posts that pertain to HS I'll link to it both here and on the homepage.

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-06">Thurs 6/6 - First week complete</span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            More head/desk sentiments brewing for the majority of the day, although progress was definitely made on the backbone.js front.  Paired with someone at the very end of the day that helped clear up some roadblocks which was a definite relief.  I have the foodmap rendering its initial state properly, and it's all still being driven by the contents of a static json file.  But the core of backbone is managing events, so that'll be a nice challenge for next week.  I'm slowly but surely getting there.
        </li>
        <li>
            A massive roadblock I hit earlier had to do with the fact that I forgot to think about javascript asynchronously.  I've run into similar issues before with code that "should work," specifically concerning manipulating an AJAX response.  I think I let out an audible grown when I realized what the problem was.  Specifically: when you fetch() a collection in backbone and attempt to render() it, remember that the fetch() is asynchronous.  Listen for the "reset" event to call render() or else you might hit a race condition.
        </li>

            <a href="http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/james-somers-web-developer-money/" target="_blank">This article</a> made the rounds on HN and twitter today.  Lots of food for thought that I'm too mentally drained to expound on right now.
        </li>
        <li>
            Todo: moar backbone. I think I'm relatively close to finishing the refactor.

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-05">Weds 6/5 - Head, meet desk</span>
    <ul>
        <li>For all of the power and flexibility of a utility like nvm, installing/running node.js and avoiding obscure error messages is not as simple as it sounds.  I've learned a valuable lesson: when all else fails (1) delete the 'node_modules' folder, (2) 'npm cache clean', and (3) 'npm install' again.  Half the time that fixes things.  Also use 'node -v' to check the current node version and 'nvm use' the most current one you have installed.  For some reason the current version changes on a per-folder basis (?).  More info about setting a default node version <a href="http://codetheory.in/using-node-version-manager-nvm-to-manage-multiple-node-js-versions/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Got Addy's node.js/mongoDB example working locally, which is just all kinds of exciting.</li>
        <li>Attempting to backbone-ify my own code was less successful, but it's because <a href="https://github.com/danielna/foodmap-backbone/commit/94356042b3a26a416792f0d0772c8f84c63771fc" title="Relevant commit message" target="_blank">I got caught up on some minute details that I shouldn't have worried about so much.</a>  Specifically setting up backbone models when you have nested attributes.  Tomorrow morning I'm going to ignore the issue until I have something bigger-picture working and then come back to it, as opposed to spending another 4 hours wanting to slam my head into my desk.</li>
        <li>That being said, I find the "slam-head-into-desk" period a pretty important part of any learning experience.  I go through it every time I try to learn something new.  You read StackOverflow Q&As, write horrible code, read more examples and sit on the cusp of giving up in frustration until suddenly, for seemingly no reason, you get it.  But it's not actually "for no reason," but rather the superficially unproductive (but actually productive) time you spent wanting to slam your head into your desk.  It's the time you spent eliminating stupid ideas from the realm of possibility.  I'll sleep on things tonight and hopefully by the time I go in tomorrow my desk/head will be safe.</li>
        <li>It blows my mind to be able to create a web server with a single .js file.</li>
        <li>There's a regular pun competition in Brooklyn called "Punderdome."  I've yet to go, but is that the greatest name for a pun competition or what?</li>
        <li>Joined an algorithms/data structures study group that will go through a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algo" target="_blank">coursera course</a> together.  Take that, massive gaps in my academic CS knowledge.</li>
        <li>Todo: backbone-ify <a href="http://www.novafoodmap.com" target="_blank">the foodmap</a>, and then node.js/mongo-ify the foodmap.  It's a nice little project for the first couple weeks of hackerschool.</li>

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-04">Tues 6/4 - Todo MVC</span>
    <ul>
        <li>It's pretty remarkable to see how self directed everyone is. There's this unspoken pressure to focus or get "left behind."  Not in the sense that anyone is judging you (or even cares), but more that the opportunity cost of goofing off is big.  As Nick said yesterday, there aren't many programmers anywhere that get to focus solely on their craft for three months like this.</li>
        <li>While the level of experience of people here varies a lot, it's easy to see why the powers that be at HS don't accept completely inexperienced beginners to the program.  It's for their own benefit.  Without the knowledge to self-educate and/or be self-directed, itâ€™d be a waste of time to come here.  There's so little formal structure that it definitely lends itself best to those who can sit down and work on things immediately, or at least function without the need to have their hand held.  It's not beginner unfriendly, but you need to be a purposeful beginner.</li>
        <li>You know that feeling when you're in a coffee shop working on something and there's enough ambient noise/activity that it keeps you awake but it's not distracting?  It's like that.  Except everyone is talking about programming.  It's awesome.</li>
        <li>I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316017930&linkCode=as2&tag=musings01b1-20" title="Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell" target="_blank">Outliers</a> on the 18-stop subway ride to/from HS, and it seems oddly serendiptious.  It wasn't intentional.  But the notion of 10,000 hours to master something... it's appropriate.  I'm about halfway through, and while I feel like Gladwell can be unnecessarily verbose/includes too many redundant anecdotes to make a point, the crux of what I've read so far is this: while outliers are absolutely affected by external circumstances and sheer, dumb luck, working harder/smarter than their peers was a (as in, one of several) defining charateristic of their success.</li>
        <li>Todo: more <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">backbone.js</a>, which is really <a href="https://github.com/danielna/backbone-fundamentals" title="backbone-fundamentals on github" target="_blank">starting to come together mentally</a>.  Highly recommended so far for those who have js experience. A nice thing about this tutorial is that it'll serve as a very shallow introduction to node.js and mongoDB.</li>

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-03">Mon 6/3 - First Day!</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Everything kicked off with some networking and an inspiring introduction by Nick/David covering the ideology/atmosphere of hackerschool.</li>
        <li>HS uses a pretty cool chat app that was built by some HS alumni.</li>
        <li>Sadly the "nearby locations" for Yelp are all $$$-$$$$, but such is life in Soho (and NYC in general).</li>
        <li>Decided to make this log, both for future nostalgia and a way to tangibly track my progress moving forward.</li>
        <li>The diversity of the group is really amazing.  Older, younger, management consultants, ex-Wall Streeters, college students, a high school student, people who have programmed for 10+ years and people who have programmed < 1 year, people who live overseas, across the country, etc.  The diversity will be a tremendous asset for the batch.  Come to think of it, it's unlikely that I'll ever be part of another community during the course of my adult life that has this kind of diversity of people and experiences.</li>
        <li>Todo: <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">backbone.js</a> and <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a>.</li>

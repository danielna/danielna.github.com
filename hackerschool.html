    <div id="help-content">
        In June 2013 I started my three months at <a href="/2013/05/19/cracker-barrel-and-hackerschool.html" title="Cracker Barrel and hackerschool">hackerschool</a>.  This is where I'll keep a log of what I'm working on/thinking/experiencing/etc.  I'm envisioning something kind of like twitter, but less ephemeral.  It'll be similarly stream-of-conscience.  When I write longer-form posts that pertain to HS I'll link to it both here and on the homepage.

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-24">Mon 6/24 - JS Design Patterns</span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Had a good talk with a friend/old coworker last night about a lot of things, including some concerns I had about what to focus on here.  While there is a social pressure here not to focus explicitly on job-related skills, I think that's a luxury that's only really affordable to those who don't worry about their imminent employability (or those who aren't entering the workforce).  That isn't to say I don't think I'll find a job (I do), but I think it's un/realistic/pragmatic to fill three months of unemployment with non-directed whimsy.  I've decided to optimize my time by solidifying my understanding of javascript as much as possible, because I'm already far enough along with js that I know I like it and can work with it professionally.  While I still want to explore python/backend work, I know it won't be a core competency after two-three months of experience.  Would I rather be hired as a junior python dev or a mid/senior js dev?  The answer is obvious.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/" target="_blank">Started reading</a>, finally.
        </li>
        <li> Notes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I don't typically use object.prototype in JS because I think creating new instances of function declarations (with their embedded methods) is easier.  I figured prototype made sense when you had a lot of inheritance going on between objects but I've never actually encountered that use case.  Turns out that there's a general performance reason to go the object.prototype route -- when you create new instances of the same object, its functions all refer back to the prototype, rather than being created over again for no reason.  Mind blown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Module pattern makes sense, and I've been using the "Revealing Module Pattern" without knowing what it was called.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The singleton pattern is interesting but I've never used it in practice and it appears to come with some controversy (too many singletons can be symptomatic of poor design).  Seems to suffer from similar design issues as having a program with a lot of globals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Observer/<a href="https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-tiny-pubsub" target="_blank">pubsub</a> pattern will be really helpful, especially for de-coupling ajax callbacks.  The mediator pattern seems to be redundant at first, but it's a lot easier to pub/sub against a single global medium than pub/sub objects individually. Remember: <a href="http://thejacklawson.com/Mediator.js/" target='_blank'>mediator.js</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The factory pattern will be one of those things that I doubt I'll use but it's valuable to know of.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After some minor discussions with other folks, I have a better understanding of binding `this` with .call() and .apply(), as it's used pretty frequently throughout the examples.

    <ul>
        <li>
            This will likely be the shortest update I have so far, but I've been feeling a bit burned out/sick of node so I took a break for a day.  Today was spent tying up some loose ends on some older projects that have nothing to do with hackerschool.  Nothing super notable to speak of here, but a lot of time was spent practicing skills related to general web design, responsive design, and media queries.
        </li>
        <li>

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-19">Weds 6/19 - REST done, Auth is not</span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Finished the full REST API today, in addition to refactoring the location of some code in various views to make the code more MVC-ish.  I have this weird variation of MVC going on where the Views (which have a lot of logic in them, but that's because controllers don't actually exist in Backbone) are not necessarily created equal.  Composite views (made up of several sub-views) handle more responsibility/functionality than their components.  I'm not sure if there's a canonical way of philosophically structuring code and functionality between Routers and Views in bb, but based on a lot of reading and discussions there doesn't seem to be one "right" way.  I'm starting to think that the most important thing is to do it consistently.
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm getting a better understanding of how to use events between the router/views to handle application flow.
        </li>
        <li>
            Started to look into user auth with Passport.js, but found <a href="http://passportjs.org/guide/" target="_blank">the guide</a> largely unhelpful.  There's a lot of text/code but not a lot of reasoning, which ultimately results in a lot of magic.  The tutorials I've seen on the web so far suffer from similar issues.
        </li>
        <li>
            Todo: I'm starting to run low of my headdesk tolerance so I'm thinking of doing some general js enrichment and reading more about how Connect/Express work before I dive back into actually coding.

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-18">Tues 6/18 - Memory Leak Purgatory</span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A pretty frustrating day overall but full of necessary growing pains.  Once I wired everything into a single page app (SPA) I started to see some really strange behavior -- like trying to fire a PUT would simultaneously send off 2-3-4 POST calls, depending on the number of screens I clicked through in order to get there.  That was weird.  But after a lot (note: a LOT) more research/googling/blogposts/pair discussions, I realized it was <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7567404/backbone-js-repopulate-or-recreate-the-view/7607853#7607853" target="_blank">because my views/bindings weren't being removed from memory as I navigated through the app</a>.  So my "click #submit" was being bound to views that I had removed from the DOM (but not destroyed), which would in turn fire off multiple submissions when I submitted a form a lot farther down the line.
        </li>
        <li>
            My solution was to keep track of the current view within the router.  I added a .close() function to the relevant views to unbind all of its own events and to remove the events/dom elements for its children (which I now store in an array on each view).  When I'm about to instantiate a new view within the router, I .close() the old view and instantiate the new one.
        </li>
        <li>
            tl;dr: Before rendering a new view, I remove the old view from the DOM and unbind all of its events (and those of its sub-views).
        </li>
        <li>
            I don't know if I'm crazy about the SPA idea in general.  It introduces a lot of weird variability -- SEO, managing state between routes, what to route and what not to route -- that I'm not sure are worth the benefits of a sexy user experience.  I like Backbone though, and I see the utility in having a bunch of mini-SPAs throughout one application, or using Backbone MVC concepts without the routing.  Regardless as an exercise I will continue to develop the foodmap as a full SPA.
        </li>
        <li>
            PUT works now.  So GET, PUT and POST are functioning.  Progress -- slow, frustrating progress.
        </li>
        <li>
            Todo: DELETE and begin authentication.  If I need a break (likely) I might start reading more about <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/" target='_blank'>JavaScript Design Patterns</a>.

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-17">Mon 6/17 - Routing</span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Moment of enlightenment this morning: I needed to start using routers.  While I've known about single page apps for a while, I didn't connect the dots between storing markup in templates and the hashed URLs until now.  The sole html file in the since-refactored codebase is an index.html with a div.app-container.  As you navigate to different routes (i.e. '/', '/#/admin', '/#/admin/id') the contents of app-container changes via javascript, not via redirects to other .html pages.  I'm not sure why this wasn't clear to me earlier, but that was a good refactor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ran into a race condition today with attempting to load my google maps-related js (which loads asynchrously) and my map overlay library (<a href="http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infobox/docs/examples.html" target="_blank">infobox.js</a>) which depends on gmaps.  With some googling I was able to discover the <a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/requirejs-plugins" target='_blank'>async plugin for requireJS</a>, which facilitates the loading of asynchronous scripts.  This would still <em>sometimes</em> break infobox (which is a good sign of a race condition) until I found a stackoverflow answer somewhere that talked about <a href="https://github.com/danielna/foodmap-node/blob/master/site/assets/js/foodmap.init.js#L19" target="_blank">specifying script dependencies in requireJS</a>.  That fixed things nicely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spent the next several hours getting nowhere with POST/PUT of the foodmap listings, although the application routing was finally set up properly.  Took a break for our tech talk at Ebay and to commute back uptown, and logging back in later in the evening for a few hours was productive enough to get the GET/POST/PUT operations working properly.  There are some weird bugs that are showing up related to some under-the-hood backbone stuff, but I've marked them as Todos for tomorrow.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have a feeling that I'm not doing the form processing in the way that backbone was designed for it to be done.  It's very manual right now -- I'm manually extracting/injecting model values into the form with hard-coded selectors.  I think there's a better way to do things but I'm having trouble finding non-trivial examples of backbone/node REST code in the wild.  I don't need to look at another todo app with a single view.
        </li>
        <li>
            As much as I'd like to participate in this algorithms class in parallel to everything else I'm working on (and my batchmates), I'm having trouble finding the time to devote to the weekly lectures/problem sets.  I may have to de-prioritize it for now for my own sanity.  That isn't to say it's still not a priority for me, but I'd rather focus on one significant thing at a time and do it well than multiple things that suffer in quality/devotion.

        </li>
        <li>
            Todos: Fix the backbone bugs, get DELETE working, begin setting up user accounts and authentication.  Longer term: make things pretty.

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-15">Sat 6/15 - Thoughts on pacing</span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Took the boltbus down to DC today for Father's Day weekend.  The 1030am bus arrived into DC at 5pm (orig scheduled 2:45pm), and major onboard-computing malfunctions led to us being on the side of the highway four times.  So that was fun.
        </li>
        <li>
            It's 3am on Friday night (Saturday) and I'm starting to think about pacing.  I have three months here that I definitely want to maximize so I want to remain diligent about the amount of time I'm allocating to whatever it is I'm working on.  I had several major goals: (1) python, (2) javascript MVC, (3) algorithms and (3) objective-c.  Over the next two weeks I'd like to continue with (2) and (3), with an end state being a functional backbone/node.js app, served on EC2, with working user accounts and the ability to create/edit/delete maps.  It won't be as fleshed out/UX-optimized as I'd ultimately like it to be but it'll serve nicely as a future work-in-progress pet project.  I'd also like to be caught up on all of the algorithms lectures/problem sets, which will have to be completed in javascript.
        </li>
        <li>
            Similarly to any real-world project, effective HS time management boils down to scope creep.  As much as I'd love to compare/contrast js mvc frameworks like Angular and Ember, they'll have to be left as "nice to haves."  But once I get up to speed with python/flask in month two I'll likely be building more webapps, so that may or may not open the door nicely for some deviations from backbone.
        </li>
        <li>
            Things I'm also super intrigued by: websockets, d3/processing/data viz, test driven development.  It'd be great to include some of that in whatever I work on too.
        </li>
        <li>
            ... scope creep might be a harder problem to manage than I thought.  And I'll need to start being more diligent about putting time in on Fridays/weekends.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Todo: Still PUT/DELETE and user accounts.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <span class="date" id="2013-06-13">Thu 6/13 - End of Week 2</span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Some refactoring within both backbone and node today.  I don't have a lot of commits to show, but the majority of my time was spent figuring out how to do things in mongo.  Successfully imported/exported json from the db.  GET/POST-ing to the node API works so I'm successfully able to add new restaurants to the map.  The next step is to fill out the "rest" (... wat) of the API functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
            I think I'll host this on EC2 when it's time to go live.  A lot of people go the heroku route (especially with node) but I think EC2 is more representative of what I'd actually do for a real-world application.  And I hear Heroku is supposed to get stupid expensive very quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Todo: PUT/DELETE and user accounts.  User accounts are pandora's box though -- security, sessions, oauth?, etc.
        </li>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielna/foodmap-node" target="_blank">Started the node/mongo integration</a> of my foodmap, and finally having a multi-page app (now with an admin console) gives some real-world utility to using RequireJS and Backbone.  It's awesome to be able to use the same model/collection with different views and have all of the dependencies managed in js rather than through some tedious declaration in an html file.
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm using <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a> (for node and mongo respectively) to run things, and I'm not sure how I feel about it.  I'm not informed enough to know whether these are good or bad things (although a lot of people seem to use Express) or if it'd be better for me to go the more native node and mongo routes.  Whatever.  For now I'll just keep going in whichever direction keeps me productive.
        </li>
        <li>
            Been watching some algorithms coursera lectures on the train and I'm hoping that this is the time that I actually follow through with learning this stuff.  Admittedly I haven't hit a lot of times in the course of real work where I've explicitly felt the need for algorithm knowledge, but it has happened.  Regardless it'll just help round out my programming ability in a holistic sense.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Started off the day pairing and learning how to work within the node javascript <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" target="_blank">REPL</a>, which is essentially the Javascript console in the Chrome/Firefox dev tools.  People seem to really be into REPLs here.  I've worked in devtools before and I didn't really see the utlity of using a REPL for dev purposes, but the ability to include modules via npm has really changed my understanding of how they'd speed up development.  It's instant feedback with tab-completion.  It's random stuff like this that really hammers home how important it is to be part of a tech community.
        </li>
        <li>
            I derailed my node/mongo plans temporarily to get a better understanding of (1) RequireJS and (2) event management in backbone, and also explore things like <a href="http://marionettejs.com/" target="_blank">Marionette.js</a>.  AMD/dependency management is something I definitely want to understand (and a problem we ran into on my project at my most recent job), and the event aggregator/mediator patterns are the keys to really solidifying my backbone understanding.  Well, outside of routing.  And data-binding.  I think I'll end up tabling Marionette until I appreciate what it provides, similar to the transition from vanilla js -> backbone.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/danielna/foodmap-backbone" target="_blank">Finished wrapping the foodmap in RequireJS.</a> The good: I wrapped everything in require and it works. The bad: The foodmap at its current state is a horrible use case for something like this because I'm essentially loading all the dependencies on page load anyway.  Once the site becomes more fleshed out/interactive with different screens Require will have more utility, but for now it was practically pointless.  Which doesn't mean it wasn't a good learning exercise (it was). Hopefully it'll help facilitate future implementations of the library.
        </li>
        <li>
            People are doing some really cool things here.  I'm super intrigued by <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> and saw a simple prototype someone wrote that featured concurrent drawing between different users on a single js canvas. If I keep talking about different javascript libraries/technologies I might end up never moving onto python. Unsure right now if that's a horrible thing; three months of dedicated js could churn out some really interesting projects.
        </li>
        <li>
            Todo: Catch up on lectures for the coursera Algorithms discussion group I'm in, start node/mongo for real.  A fellow hackerschooler showed me some minor node functionality today and I'll say it again: a server in one file of js blows my freaking mind.

    <ul>
        <li>
            My flight from LA landed last night at 1:30am in Newark.  I was freaking tired this morning.  Also, it costs $100 (including tolls) for a cab from Newark to Manhattan.
        </li>
        <li>
            I've <a href="https://github.com/danielna/foodmap-backbone" target="_blank">successfully backbone-ified my foodmap!</a>  It only took a week and a lot of frustration, but it feels good to have worked through the roadblocks.  It only goes to reaffirm the fact that head-to-desk time is the best way to learn things.  Tutorials, <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">even excellent ones</a>, are only so effective at conveying understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
            At a glance the foodmap in backbone is identical to the non-backbone version, but I'm feeling really good about the imposed structure and I can definitely see how it would streamline large-scale js development.  It was "easier" for me to write everything with vanilla JS, but it was devolving into a spaghetti code base of events and jQuery selectors.  MVC just feels right.
        </li>
        <li>
            I mentioned it earlier but Backbone isn't very beginner friendly, mostly because if you don't understand concepts like context, scoping and closures you're going to have a bad time.  In the grand scheme of things I don't consider myself very proficient at JS, but it was nice to discover that I know enough of the fundamentals to make sense of things like backbone.  And because of the nature of backbone contexts refactoring the foodmap had the ancillary benefit of teaching me more about context in general.
        </li>
        <li>
            All of this commentary needs the massive caveat that I have yet to bind my code to a backend, since everything is still running off of a static json file.  I've heard people complain about backbone data-binding in the past so I'll have to see how I feel about all of this once that's completed.  I am glad that I decided to go the static json route, since I should generally just be able to plug-in an API endpoint and go.  I almost sound like I believe that it'll be that easy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Todo: It's webapp time. Node.js and mongoDB!  Many more head/desk moments to follow.

            More head/desk sentiments brewing for the majority of the day, although progress was definitely made on the backbone.js front.  Paired with someone at the very end of the day that helped clear up some roadblocks which was a definite relief.  I have the foodmap rendering its initial state properly, and it's all still being driven by the contents of a static json file.  But the core of backbone is managing events, so that'll be a nice challenge for next week.  I'm slowly but surely getting there.

        <li>
            A massive roadblock I hit earlier had to do with the fact that I forgot to think about javascript asynchronously.  I've run into similar issues before with code that "should work," specifically concerning manipulating an AJAX response.  I think I let out an audible grown when I realized what the problem was.  Specifically: when you fetch() a collection in backbone and attempt to render() it, remember that the fetch() is asynchronous.  Listen for the "reset" event to call render() or else you might hit a race condition.

            <a href="http://www.aeonmagazine.com/living-together/james-somers-web-developer-money/" target="_blank">This article</a> made the rounds on HN and twitter today.  Lots of food for thought that I'm too mentally drained to expound on right now.
        </li>
        <li>
            Todo: moar backbone. I think I'm relatively close to finishing the refactor.

    <ul>
        <li>For all of the power and flexibility of a utility like nvm, installing/running node.js and avoiding obscure error messages is not as simple as it sounds.  I've learned a valuable lesson: when all else fails (1) delete the 'node_modules' folder, (2) 'npm cache clean', and (3) 'npm install' again.  Half the time that fixes things.  Also use 'node -v' to check the current node version and 'nvm use' the most current one you have installed.  For some reason the current version changes on a per-folder basis (?).  More info about setting a default node version <a href="http://codetheory.in/using-node-version-manager-nvm-to-manage-multiple-node-js-versions/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Got Addy's node.js/mongoDB example working locally, which is just all kinds of exciting.</li>
        <li>Attempting to backbone-ify my own code was less successful, but it's because <a href="https://github.com/danielna/foodmap-backbone/commit/94356042b3a26a416792f0d0772c8f84c63771fc" title="Relevant commit message" target="_blank">I got caught up on some minute details that I shouldn't have worried about so much.</a>  Specifically setting up backbone models when you have nested attributes.  Tomorrow morning I'm going to ignore the issue until I have something bigger-picture working and then come back to it, as opposed to spending another 4 hours wanting to slam my head into my desk.</li>
        <li>That being said, I find the "slam-head-into-desk" period a pretty important part of any learning experience.  I go through it every time I try to learn something new.  You read StackOverflow Q&As, write horrible code, read more examples and sit on the cusp of giving up in frustration until suddenly, for seemingly no reason, you get it.  But it's not actually "for no reason," but rather the superficially unproductive (but actually productive) time you spent wanting to slam your head into your desk.  It's the time you spent eliminating stupid ideas from the realm of possibility.  I'll sleep on things tonight and hopefully by the time I go in tomorrow my desk/head will be safe.</li>
        <li>It blows my mind to be able to create a web server with a single .js file.</li>
        <li>There's a regular pun competition in Brooklyn called "Punderdome."  I've yet to go, but is that the greatest name for a pun competition or what?</li>
        <li>Joined an algorithms/data structures study group that will go through a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algo" target="_blank">coursera course</a> together.  Take that, massive gaps in my academic CS knowledge.</li>
        <li>Todo: backbone-ify <a href="http://www.novafoodmap.com" target="_blank">the foodmap</a>, and then node.js/mongo-ify the foodmap.  It's a nice little project for the first couple weeks of hackerschool.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>It's pretty remarkable to see how self directed everyone is. There's this unspoken pressure to focus or get "left behind."  Not in the sense that anyone is judging you (or even cares), but more that the opportunity cost of goofing off is big.  As Nick said yesterday, there aren't many programmers anywhere that get to focus solely on their craft for three months like this.</li>
        <li>While the level of experience of people here varies a lot, it's easy to see why the powers that be at HS don't accept completely inexperienced beginners to the program.  It's for their own benefit.  Without the knowledge to self-educate and/or be self-directed, it’d be a waste of time to come here.  There's so little formal structure that it definitely lends itself best to those who can sit down and work on things immediately, or at least function without the need to have their hand held.  It's not beginner unfriendly, but you need to be a purposeful beginner.</li>
        <li>You know that feeling when you're in a coffee shop working on something and there's enough ambient noise/activity that it keeps you awake but it's not distracting?  It's like that.  Except everyone is talking about programming.  It's awesome.</li>
        <li>I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316017930&linkCode=as2&tag=musings01b1-20" title="Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell" target="_blank">Outliers</a> on the 18-stop subway ride to/from HS, and it seems oddly serendiptious.  It wasn't intentional.  But the notion of 10,000 hours to master something... it's appropriate.  I'm about halfway through, and while I feel like Gladwell can be unnecessarily verbose/includes too many redundant anecdotes to make a point, the crux of what I've read so far is this: while outliers are absolutely affected by external circumstances and sheer, dumb luck, working harder/smarter than their peers was a (as in, one of several) defining charateristic of their success.</li>
        <li>Todo: more <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/" target="_blank">backbone.js</a>, which is really <a href="https://github.com/danielna/backbone-fundamentals" title="backbone-fundamentals on github" target="_blank">starting to come together mentally</a>.  Highly recommended so far for those who have js experience. A nice thing about this tutorial is that it'll serve as a very shallow introduction to node.js and mongoDB.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Everything kicked off with some networking and an inspiring introduction by Nick/David covering the ideology/atmosphere of hackerschool.</li>
        <li>HS uses a pretty cool chat app that was built by some HS alumni.</li>
        <li>Sadly the "nearby locations" for Yelp are all $$$-$$$$, but such is life in Soho (and NYC in general).</li>
        <li>Decided to make this log, both for future nostalgia and a way to tangibly track my progress moving forward.</li>
        <li>The diversity of the group is really amazing.  Older, younger, management consultants, ex-Wall Streeters, college students, a high school student, people who have programmed for 10+ years and people who have programmed < 1 year, people who live overseas, across the country, etc.  The diversity will be a tremendous asset for the batch.  Come to think of it, it's unlikely that I'll ever be part of another community during the course of my adult life that has this kind of diversity of people and experiences.</li>

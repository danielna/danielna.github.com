    <div id="help-content">
        In June 2013 I started my three months at <a href="/2013/05/19/cracker-barrel-and-hackerschool.html" title="Cracker Barrel and hackerschool">hackerschool</a>.  This is where I'll keep a log of what I'm working on/thinking/experiencing/etc.  I'm envisioning something kind of like twitter, but less ephemeral.  It'll be similarly stream-of-conscience.  When I write longer-form posts that pertain to HS I'll link to it both here and on the homepage.

    <ul>
        <li> Everything got kicked off with some networking and an inspiring introduction by Nick/David covering the ideology/atmosphere of hackerschool.</li>
        <li>HS uses a pretty cool chat app that was built by some HS alumni.</li>
        <li>Sadly the "nearby locations" for Yelp are all $$$-$$$$, but such is life in Soho (and NYC in general).</li>
        <li>Decided to make this log, both for future nostalgia and a way to tangibly track my progress moving forward.</li>
        <li>Plans for this week are to dive deep into js frameworks (backbone, angular, ?) and python (vanilla and flask).</li>

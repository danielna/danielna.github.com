> I beg young people to travel. If you don’t have a passport, get one. Take a summer, get a backpack and go to Delhi, go to Saigon, go to Bangkok, go to Kenya. Have your mind blown. Eat interesting food. Dig some interesting people. Have an adventure. Be careful. Come back and you’re going to see your country differently, you’re going to see your president differently, no matter who it is. Music, culture, food, water. Your showers will become shorter. You’re going to get a sense of what globalization looks like. It’s not what Tom Friedman writes about; I’m sorry. You’re going to see that global climate change is very real. And that for some people, their day consists of walking 12 miles for four buckets of water. And so there are lessons that you can’t get out of a book that are waiting for you at the other end of that flight. A lot of people—Americans and Europeans—come back and go, Ohhhhh. And the light bulb goes on.

Apparently Henry Rollins travels a lot. Actually, based on his <a target="_blank" title="Wikipedia - Henry Rollins" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Rollins">wikipedia page</a>, turns out Henry Rollins is something of a renaissance man. I really had no idea.

Great interview on travel, photography, and getting out of your comfort zone.

    </h2>
    <h3 class="sr-only">Abstract</h3>
		<p>Things are broken. The deployment pipeline is painfully slow. Your engineering team has doubled in the last year and there's a lack of sufficient process and management. You git blame a file that's used everywhere but nobody understands it; the person who wrote it left the company five years ago.</p>
		<p>As a senior-level engineering leader, experience tells you things could be better. You see the gaps. If only the company adopted policy A or dumped technology B, everyone would benefit. But there's so much inertia. The company has always used B. You are frustrated. Can you actually make a difference?</p>
		<p>Yes. You are encountering organizational friction, and learning to identify, accept and push through friction is a key skill of engineering leaders. In this talk, Dan will talk about why organizational friction occurs and how to mitigate it. The ability to push through friction will distinguish you throughout your career.</p>

    </h2>
    <h3 class="sr-only">Abstract</h3>
		<p>
			CSS preprocessors like Sass add a variety of functions that streamline CSS
			development: variables, nesting, functions, mixins, etc. The documentation is
			great, the tools are mature, and starting a new project using Sass has a clear
			and straight-forward workflow. But transitioning a large legacy codebase from
			CSS to Sass is a different story. CSS syntax errors that may be harmless in
			production can completely prevent Sass from compiling. But fixing those errors
			creates a far juicier problem: will we introduce visual bugs by fixing syntax bugs?
		</p>
		<p>
			At Etsy we faced this exact question multiplied across over 400,000 lines of
			CSS and 2100+ CSS files. During this talk I’ll discuss the tools we used and
			built throughout our Sass workflow, from the initial transformation of CSS
			files using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to the libsass-powered Sass to CSS
			render pipeline we have running on all development machines. I’ll cover some
			of the tools we’ve built in-house to mitigate some of the biggest potential 
			pitfalls of Sass (Sass live lint), how we ramped up our development and
			production services to gain confidence in our process and how this entire
			effort led to a single 1.2M line push that didn’t break production and had
			minimal impact to developer and designer workflows.
